# OpenCV-GestureControlled-Robotic Hand
This project integrates OpenCV, Pyserial, and MediaPipe to create a robotic hand controlled by hand gestures. OpenCV enables real-time gesture recognition, while Pyserial facilitates communication with Arduino servo motors. Leveraging MediaPipe enhances gesture recognition accuracy. This system offers intuitive prosthetic control, enhancing accessibility for users with limb differences
